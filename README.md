N3P
===

N3P is a concept based on IPv6 to allow the static and dynamic routing adjustment to enforce the data exchange between selected parties. N3P was initially published and presented at CyCon2012. The concept was developed to heighten the level of control of transmitted data and to technically enforce a negotiated level of privacy and confidentiality. Due to the recent debates regarding the establishment of national networks, we felt it worthwhile to release the concept on github aswell.
